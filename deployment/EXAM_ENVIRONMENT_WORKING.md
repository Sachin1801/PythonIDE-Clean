## 🚀 Next Steps for Exam Day

### Before the Exam:
1. **Upload Exam Questions**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/sachinadlakha/on-campus/PythonIDE-Clean/server
   # Edit the exam content in init_exam_users.py (lines 311-359)
   uv run python init_exam_users.py --reset-files
   ```

2. **Test Student Login**:
   - Go to: http://exam.pythonide-classroom.tech/
   - Login as: `exam_sa8820` / `UTQ9T`
   - Verify they see only their folder

3. **Distribute Credentials**:
   - Print individual slips from `deployment/exam_credentials.csv`
   - Give students their `exam_{netid}` username and password

### During the Exam:
- **Students use**: http://exam.pythonide-classroom.tech/
- **Professors monitor via**: `exam_sa9082` account
- **Main IDE remains accessible** for regular classes (optional: enable lockdown)

### After the Exam:
- Export submissions from exam database
- Grade in exam environment
- Keep environment running for future exams

## 🔧 Optional: Enable HTTPS for Exam Subdomain

Your exam environment currently works on HTTP. To add HTTPS:

1. **Request SSL Certificate** (in AWS Certificate Manager):
   ```bash
   # Request certificate for exam subdomain
   aws acm request-certificate \
     --domain-name exam.pythonide-classroom.tech \
     --validation-method DNS \
     --region us-east-2
   ```

2. **Add Certificate to ALB HTTPS Listener**:
   - Go to AWS Console → ALB → Listeners → HTTPS:443
   - Add the new certificate as an additional certificate

This is optional - HTTP works fine for exams since it's internal use.
