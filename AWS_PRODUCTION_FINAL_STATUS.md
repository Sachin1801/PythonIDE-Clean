# PythonIDE AWS Production - Final Status

## üåê Production URLs
- **Main Application**: http://pythonide-classroom.tech
- **Admin Panel**: http://pythonide-classroom.tech/admin/users
- **AWS Load Balancer**: http://pythonide-alb-456687384.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. User Accounts Corrected
- **Removed**: 24 incorrectly interpreted usernames (dl8926, dl9362, etc.)

- **Updated**: All existing accounts with full names and correct roles
- **Total**: 42 accounts (3 instructors + 35 students + 4 test accounts)

### 2. Database Changes
- All users now have proper email addresses (username@college.edu)
- Full names added to all accounts
- Passwords regenerated using consistent algorithm
- Role assignments corrected (professor/student)

## üë• Complete User List

### Instructors (Professor Role)
| Username | Full Name | Password |

| sa9082 | Sachin Adlakha | XbaD157Q202* |
| et2434 | Ethan Tan | Be9R5baQde3* |
| sl7927 | Susan Liao | B4cA667Q6b9% |

### Students (35 accounts)
All student credentials are in `FINAL_CREDENTIALS.txt` and `final_credentials.csv`

### Admin/Test Accounts
| Username | Password | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| admin_editor | XuR0ibQqhw6# | Main admin with password management |
| admin_viewer | AdminView2025! | Read-only admin access |
| test_admin | TestAdmin2025! | Test professor account |
| test_student | TestStudent2025! | Test student account |

## üìÅ Directory Structure Required
Each user needs a directory in `/mnt/efs/pythonide-data/projects/ide/Local/{username}`

To fix directories on AWS, run:
```bash
python3 fix_user_directories.py
```

## üîß Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Admin Panel Access
- **Status**: The route exists but may need frontend rebuild
- **URL**: http://pythonide-classroom.tech/admin/users
- **Access**: Only admin_editor can access this panel

### Issue 2: EFS Directories
- Some user directories may still have old names
- Run `fix_user_directories.py` on the AWS container to fix

### Issue 3: Custom Domain
- The system uses http://pythonide-classroom.tech
- This redirects to the AWS load balancer
- HTTPS is not configured (uses HTTP only)

## üìù Files Generated
1. `FINAL_CREDENTIALS.txt` - Human-readable credential list
2. `final_credentials.csv` - CSV format for distribution
3. `fix_user_accounts.py` - Script to fix database users
4. `fix_user_directories.py` - Script to fix EFS directories

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy Directory Fix**: Run `fix_user_directories.py` on AWS container
2. **Test All Accounts**: Verify each user can log in
3. **Distribute Credentials**: Share CSV with students
4. **Monitor Admin Panel**: Ensure admin_editor can reset passwords

## üìä Verification Commands

Test login:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://pythonide-classroom.tech/api/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin_editor","password":"XuR0ibQqhw6#"}'
```

Check user count:
```bash
curl "http://pythonide-classroom.tech/api/admin/users?admin_username=admin_editor" \
  -H "Cookie: session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. All passwords are complex with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
2. The admin_editor account has exclusive access to password management
3. Instructors (professors) can see all student directories
4. Students can only access their own Local/{username} directory
5. The system supports 60+ concurrent users on AWS ECS
