# ðŸŽ¯ Final Routing Configuration

## âœ… ALB Routing Rules (Updated)

### HTTP (Port 80) Listener:
| Priority | Condition | Action | Target |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Host = `exam.pythonide-classroom.tech` | Forward | Exam Container |
| Default | All other traffic | Redirect to HTTPS | - |

### HTTPS (Port 443) Listener:
| Priority | Condition | Action | Target |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Host = `exam.pythonide-classroom.tech` | Forward | Exam Container |
| Default | All other traffic (including `pythonide-classroom.tech`) | Forward | **Main IDE Container** |

---

## ðŸ”„ Traffic Flow

### Main IDE (Unchanged):
```
User visits: https://pythonide-classroom.tech/
    â†“
ALB receives request (HTTPS:443)
    â†“
No matching rules (not exam subdomain)
    â†“
Default rule forwards to: Main IDE Container âœ…
    â†“
User sees: Main IDE (redirects to /editor)
```

### Exam IDE (New):
```
User visits: https://exam.pythonide-classroom.tech/
    â†“
ALB receives request (HTTPS:443)
    â†“
Matches Priority 1 rule (host-header)
    â†“
Forwards to: Exam Container âœ…
    â†“
User sees: Exam IDE (redirects to /editor)
```

---

## âœ… Main IDE Status: **UNAFFECTED**

Your main IDE will continue to work **exactly as before** because:

1. âœ… All requests to `pythonide-classroom.tech` go to the main IDE container
2. âœ… The default HTTPS rule forwards to the main target group
3. âœ… No code changes were made to the main application
4. âœ… Only the exam subdomain routes to the exam container

## ðŸ“‹ DNS Setup Required

**You need to add ONE DNS record:**

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | `exam` | `pythonide-alb-456687384.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com` | 300 |

This creates: `exam.pythonide-classroom.tech` â†’ Points to ALB

## ðŸ§ª Test Commands

### Test Main IDE (Should work NOW):
```bash
# Test HTTPS (with SSL)
curl -I https://pythonide-classroom.tech/

# Expected: 200 OK or 302 redirect to /editor
```

### Test Exam IDE (After DNS setup):
```bash
# Check DNS propagation
nslookup exam.pythonide-classroom.tech

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://exam.pythonide-classroom.tech/

# Expected: 200 OK or 302 redirect to /editor
```

### Test with Host Header (Before DNS):
```bash
# This tests the ALB routing directly
curl -I -H "Host: exam.pythonide-classroom.tech" http://pythonide-alb-456687384.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/

# Expected: 200 OK (exam container responding)
```

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

âœ… **Main IDE**: Works exactly as before at `https://pythonide-classroom.tech/`
âœ… **Exam IDE**: Will work at `https://exam.pythonide-classroom.tech/` once you add DNS record
âœ… **Complete Isolation**: Different databases, storage paths, and containers
âœ… **No Code Changes**: Both use the same application code

The routing change is **100% safe** for your main IDE!
